## This [application](https://then0rt.github.io/TodoApp/) is implemented using React.

* The local state was used as state management
* Hooks were used:
  * useState
  * useEffect
  * useMemo
  * customs hooks
* localStorage was used to store the list
* Implemented sorting by title and date of addition

## Styles
* This project is not adaptive
* Screen width: 1680px
* Tailwind was used for the stylistics of components and elements
* Without animation (I thought it was not needed here)

## Bugs
* At the first sorting, the application may break, but this is only at the first
* When changing the title, there will be no focus on the input
